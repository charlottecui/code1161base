"""Refactoring.
This excercise is very similar to week 2, exercise 2. It contains a complete
and working example, but it's very poorly written.
Your job is to go through it and make it as good as you can.
That means making it self-documenting wherever possible, adding comments where
it isn't. Take repeated code and make it into a function. Also use functions
to encapsulate concepts. If something is done many times, maybe a map or a loop
is called for. Etc.
The resulting file should feel as close to english as possible.
It must also pass the linter.
This is the first file that will be run against the pydocstyle checker. If
you've run the week5_system_prep.sh file you should be getting blue linter dots
that show you where lintere errors are. If they aren't working, you should be
getting the errors in the test output.
Some functions will have directions as external comments, once you think you
are on top of it, take these comments out. Others won't have comments and
you'll need to figure out for yourself what to do.
